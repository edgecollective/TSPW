# Solarpunk

**Solarpunk** is a term that has come to mean various things to different people; here, we take it to refer to the adoption of a generally optimistic, 'let's see how awesome we can make this!' attitude towards the possibility that we might cooperatively build an inclusive, sustainable, positive future.
