Trying to connect Decagon sensors for a Feather M0

EnviroDIY repo is [here](https://github.com/EnviroDIY/Arduino-SDI-12).

Got the 'd_simple_logger.ino' code working.  Had initially to change the address of the sensor (which was likely writing to eeprom)

Manual for 5TE is [here](http://manuals.decagon.com/Retired%20and%20Discontinued/Manuals/13509_5TE_Web.pdf)

Useful issue, here:
https://github.com/EnviroDIY/Arduino-SDI-12/issues/12

They give example code, talk about not being able to get data from sensors without adding in extra long wait time after 'M!' command.

Worked by adding delay, as per their suggestion!  Code [here](https://github.com/edgecollective/decagon-5te-feather/tree/master/d_simple_logger_ecoll).

Interesting multi-hop radio used with Decagon 5TE:

Etching new image to get to default.
