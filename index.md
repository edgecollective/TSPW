Edge Collective promotes technological sovereignty for communities living at ‘the edge’, including vulnerable cities, rural townships, farming communities, and islands.

We facilitate workshops, trainings, and collaborative development focused on building locally-owned, resilient municipal and community infrastructure using an open, collaborative design process.  Recent projects include:

- resilient communication systems
- off-grid water monitoring (flood, drought, salinity)
- retrofitting greenhouse control systems 
- capturing soil health data from remote farm fields

You can view all of our designs and code on <a href="http://github.com/edgecollective">github</a>.
