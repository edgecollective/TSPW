**DIY Infrastructure for Great Good! ("DIGG!")** is a series of classes in **applied electronics**.

We'll learn to design, build, and deploy tools for things like:

- water monitoring (floods, drought)
- solar power generation and monitoring, and
- resilient agriculture

Each class is heaviy project-based, and focuses on a different aspect of DIY infrastructure.

--- 

# Methodology

The **DIGG!** classes place a strong emphasis on:

- peer learning and teaching
- collaborative, open source designs
- decentralized tools and production
- off-grid capability using renewable energy sources
- flexible supply chains
- repair, re-use, and recycling of existing infrastructure
- open documentation and data workflows

---

# Prequisites

- The *Basic Electronics* class at Artisan's Asylum, or equivalent
- Some familiarity with Python or C programming

DIGG! classes form a coherent whole, but can also be taken independently, in any order.

# Schedule 

Each class is four weeks long, and involves one two-hour meeting per week.

# Classes 

## DIGG! I: Signals and Sensors

(Four meetings total, one meeting per week, 2 hrs per meeting.)

"DIGG! I: SIgnals and Sensors" is a four-week intensive introduction to a range of electronic sensors useful for monitoring useful physical parameters in real-world applications:  the temperature of a freezer, the light level in a greenhouse, the depth of water in a well, or the opening of a door.

We will begin with a quick overview of the various ways to bring physical measurements into the world of microelectronics, covering various protocols and simple circuits along the way.  We'll then build several prototype sensor instruments, exploring methods of validation, calibration, and error assessment. 

Some prior experience with programming (especially in Python) would be useful for this class. 


**Week 1: Signals Basics**
- Physical phenomena --> electrical signals
- Analog, Digital, ADC, DAC
- Switches, Buttons, and simple inputs

**Week 2: Signal Conditioning**

- Amplification
- Voltage dividers
- Level shifting
- Op-amps

**Week 3: Protocols**
- i2c
- spi
- uart
- custom
- muxing pins

**Week 4: Measurement, Error, Calibration**
- Light
- Temp
- Pressure
- Motion

## DIGG! II: Actuators

(Four meetings total, one meeting per week, 2 hrs per meeting.)

"DIGG! II: Actuators" is a four-week introduction to using DIY electronics to have an impact on the physical world:  controlling relays, fans, motors, lights, and other electrical equipment.

We will illustrate each type of actuator with example circuits and relevant projects, building up to a final, student-designed actuator projects.

Some prior experience with programming (especially in Python) would be useful for this class.

**Week 1: Relays and Switches**

**Week 2: Motors**

## DIGG! III: Wireless Communications

(Four meetings total, one meeting per week, 2 hrs per meeting.)

"DIGG! III: Wireless Communication" is a four-week intensive introduction to some commonly-used radio protocols.  The advantages and disadvantages of each radio technology with reference to particular applications and relevant parameters (range, power, bandwidth) will be discussed.  There will be an emphasis on developing a pragmatic working codebase for each radio type that can serve as the basis for further project development.

Some prior experience with programming (especially in Python) would be useful for this class.

**Week 1: Overview**
- Spectrum
- Licensing
- Range 

**Week 2: Wifi, Lora**
- HTTP: POST
- HTTP: GET
- Simple database interactions
- Radio packets
- Security concerns and encryption

**Week 3: Cell, Satellite**

**Week 4: Decentralized Protocols**
- Dat
- Scuttlebutt

## DIGG! IV: Custom Circuitboards

(Four meetings total, one meeting per week, 2 hrs per meeting.)

"DIGG! IV: Custom Circuitboards" provides a quick on-ramp to the world of DIY circuit board production.  After prototyping a simple student-designed circuit on a breadboard, we will proceed to designing a printed circuit board ("PCB") schematic and board layout.  We will use an inexpensive milling machine to manufacture our board designs locally;  we will also cover the process of using external fabrication services to produce PCBs.

**Week 1: Circuit design**
- Breadboarding a simple circuit

**Week 2: PCB via CAD**
- Overview of CAD programs
- KiCAD: schematics
- KiCAD: layout

**Week 3: CNC Milling**
- OtherMill

**Week 4. External ordering and assembly**
- OSHPark, others

## DIGG! V: Energy Use, Generation and Storage

(Four meetings total, one meeting per week, 2 hrs per meeting.)

"DIGG! V: Energy Use, Generation and Storage" introduces key concepts in energy production, management, and storage in the context of resilient infrastructure.  We will learn how to estimate the energy requirements for typical DIY / off-grid / resilient infrastructure projects, and will cover various practical ways of generating and storing energy for low-power electronics projects.  Students will produce a final low-power off-grid energy project of their own design.

**Week 1: Review of Power, Energy**
- D. Mackay, [Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air](https://www.withouthotair.com/)

**Week 2: Energy Generation**
- Solar
- Mechanical
- Other

**Week 3: Energy Storage**
- Batteries
- Mechanical
- Other

**Week 4: Special Topics / Projects**

## DIGG! VI: Resilient Deployments

(Four meetings total, one meeting per week, 2 hrs per meeting.)

"DIGG! VI: Resilient Infrastructure Deployment" covers the techniques necessary for successful deployments of resilient infrastrucutre projects in the field.  Best practices around the design of enclosures will be demonstrated in class, along with various approaches to integrating appropriate communications and data storage protocols in DIY deployment designs.  The class will culminate in student-designed technology deployments nearby in Somerville;  after the last class, students may continue to monitor their projects remotely, and discuss their deployment's performance via email / in-person meet-ups.
