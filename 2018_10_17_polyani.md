## alder's book review of klein

polyani:

Markets have existed for millenia -- but as adjunct to people's self-sufficient production, as way of utilizing excess / overproduction / surplus 

Market-based *economy* is more recent invention

Here, market moves to central role -- entire economic system shifts to capitalist ideal:  self-regulating system based on supply and demand of commodities produced by means of other commodities

Before market-based economy, exchange was only a secondary, ancillary mechanism of economic coordination

Dominant mechanisms were reciprocity

Forms of reciprocity: gift exchange, householding

Self-sufficient household economies

Redistribrution, in form of tributes and taxes given to and redistributed by clan or royal authority

Exchange was primarily between communities, rather than within them (lack of trust between).

Social and cultural norms powerfully shaped expectations about types of exchange behavior that were acceptable.

For market-based economy to emerge, economic activity -- production and exchange -- had to be 'disembedded' from these normative and authoritative constraints.

"Disembedded" -- freed from weight of government, as well as moral, customary, and religious constraints. Gives primary weight to untrammeled pursuit of individual pecuniary advantage.

This is the 'Great Transformation' -- passage from feudalism and pre-capitalist systems to market-based form of society we call capitalism.  Several variants:  neo-liberal, social-democractic, hierarchical -- exist today.

(Note: what is 'social-democratic' form, and its assumptions?)

Once economic activity becomes disembedded (freed of gov't and social controls), scale of markets increases, as does size of participating enterprises.

Producers find themselves forced to aim for the highest possible rates of growth and profit -- and ignore social and env externalities -- lest they become less attractive to investors than their fast-growing and more-profitable competitors.

This affects both 'virtuous' and greedy business leaders.

Despite a dynamic that would encourage commoditization, natural and human resources are not truly commodities

(can we make an energy / info theoretic argument that *nothing* is really a commodity in a finite system?)

natural and human resources are not commodities -- they are produced for sale on the market.

(what's the def. of a commodity? footnote on bottom of NP17)

natural resources are given by nature, human resources are 'produced' by families and communities.

Polanyi -- 'fictitious' commodities -- resources whose treatment as commodities contradicts the actual conditions of their production and exchange.

This contradiction manifests in two ways:

( how would Polanyi handle the issue of automation? -- once labor becomes a commodity? and -- what about expanding to sea, or to space? things can be difficult enough to be 'virtually' impossible to commodify .. is it about degrees of commodification?)

(KEY ARGS on p NP18)

NP18 -- social embeddedness 

*Double Movement* -- attempt to dis-embed and then re-embed (to correct errors)

Adler argues that re-embedding through protest won't be enough:

1. It's too slow -- because env impacts are diffuse and long-term -- and the associated protests are harder to motivate and organize.

2. It will provoke intense counter-pressure because it will impact jobs and business in the short term.  Any regulations erious enough to deal with the impending crises will deter investment, and this will trigger business leaders to counter-act.

Adler: the env crises has progessed far enough that we won't be able to redress it through regulation and protest.

We need radical de-growth.  But this would promote an economic crisis.  Regulatory effots on behalf of env now are unlikely to produce virtuous 'green growth' dynamic, but instead promote crisis. 


## Adler on 'misreading polanyi'

Adler says that Granovetter and others read Polanyi as arguming that all market transactions are *necessarily* embedded in ongoing social relations.

Polanyi critizes idea of 'timeless human nature that privileges individual material self-interest'

(not sure I understand distinction on bottom p NP21 re: Granovetter vs Polanyi's notions of embeddedness)
